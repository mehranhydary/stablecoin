/**
 * @title MiladySCEngine
 * @author ùñí
 *
 * The system is designed to be as minimal as possible, and have the tokens maintain a
 * token == $1 peg.
 * The stablecoin has properties:
 * - Collateral will be Milady NFTx Vault
 * - Dollar pegged
 * - Algorithmically stable
 *
 * It is similar to DAI if DAI had no governance, no fees.
 *
 * Our MSC system should always be "overcollateralized". At no point, should the value of all
 * all collateral <= the $ backed value of all the MSC.
 *
 * @notice This contract is the core of the MiladySC System. It handles all the logic for mining
 * and redemption MiladySC, as well as depositing and withdrawing collateral.
 * @notice This contract is very loosely based on the MakerDAO DSS (DAI).
