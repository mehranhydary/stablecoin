# Stablecoin Research

Making a stablecoin that is:

1. The relative stability will be anchored or pegged to the US dollar
2. The stability mechanism (the way we do minting) will be algorithmic (i.e. decentralized)
3. Collateral type for this stablecoin will be exogenous (crypto); can use a Milady NFTx vault positions
